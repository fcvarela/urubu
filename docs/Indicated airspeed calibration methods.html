<p><b>FLIGHT TESTING TO DETERMINE TRUE AIR SPEED</b></p>

<p><b>-- AS PART OF THE PROCESS TO CALIBRATE THE AIR SPEED
INDICATOR </b></p>

<p><font size="3">by Peter Chapman</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Pilots of homebuilt aircraft may be interested
in determining the amount of error in their indicated air speed.
Various methods are available, but that most commonly used for
homebuilt aircraft uses ground speed as the independent source of
speed information. Correcting ground speed for wind and density
altitude produces the numbers which the airspeed indicator
ideally would read. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Compensating for wind effects is the difficult
part, as perfect no-wind conditions are hard to find, especially
if one isn&#146;t lifting off at dawn. Over the years I have
heard of various wind-compensation schemes, not all of which
sounded mathematically accurate. This write-up is the result of
compiling and comparing the various methods, to help me decide
how to calibrate the airspeed indicator on the homebuilt I
co-own. This document is not exhaustive, but should give the
reader a useful overview of some of the methods that have been
tried. I have no great insight into test flying, as I am a low
time private pilot (200 hrs). I do have a degree in aeronautical
engineering, but only worked in the field for a short time after
graduation.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">If you simply wish to get the job done, without
much fuss and wading through a lot of theory, just try a method
such as #5 below.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>GENERAL TECHNIQUES</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Results can naturally be more accurate when
more data points can be taken, and the more accurately the tests
can be flown -- maintaining constant airspeed, heading (or ground
track, depending on the test), altitude, and engine power. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">But if there&#146;s turbulence, thermals, or
other variations in air movement, it becomes impossible to hold
all instrument readings constant. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">If there is thermal activity, it may be better
to focus on holding a constant airspeed, as chasing altitude in a
thermal would require putting the nose down and increasing speed.
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Some test methods require tracks to be flown,
while others require headings. The aircraft&#146;s equipment may
determine which is more convenient. A directional gyro helps to
fly accurate headings, although it may precess in the time it
takes to fly a few test legs. A GPS will provide accurate track
information. Whether it is more difficult to maintain a
reasonably steady ground track or a reasonably steady heading
when there is turbulence and varying winds is another issue. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In doing airspeed indicator calibrations, a set
of test runs is flown for each indicated air speed for which a
correction is desired. Indicated air speed errors result from
errors in measuring pitot pressure, static pressure, and internal
instrument errors. The methods described here will account for
the combined errors from all three sources. Error from the
instrument alone can also be determined separately by ground
tests, by connecting the instrument to a manometer made from
clear &#145;vinyl&#146; tubing. Rolling up one end of the tubing
will create a difference in fluid levels in the manometer, which
corresponds to a particular pressure, which in turn corresponds
to a particular airspeed that should be shown on the dial. (One

<p><font size="3"><b>SIX METHODS OF COMPENSATING FOR WINDS</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>1) 'OPPOSITE HEADING RUNS' OR 'OPPOSITE
TRACK RUNS'</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is an old and often mentioned method. True
air speed is calculated by averaging the ground speed from runs
along ground tracks or headings 180 degrees apart. Sources have
suggested using a 3 to 5 mile course, measured accurately on a
topographic map. Nowadays two GPS waypoints could be used. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Measurements of ground speed are made either by
GPS or by using a stopwatch for the time to cover a measured
distance. Sources that describe timing a measured course don't
always note how easily errors can occur. Even over a 5 mile
course, a 1 second error in timing becomes a 1/2 mph error at 100
mph, or 2.2 mph at 200 mph. It becomes important to mark the time
accurately, which is more an issue of determining when the start
and finishing line have been crossed, than just being quick to
punch the stopwatch button. The pilot may think the aircraft is
passing a point or line on the ground, when that mark is not yet
directly under the aircraft, exactly 90 degrees down from the
horizon. The greater the altitude above ground level, the greater
the probably error. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Conclusions: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">All variations of this method are
approximations, but one variation is more accurate than others.
Accuracy is greatly improved if the flight can be made parallel
to the wind, with little crosswind component. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Details: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Typically flight along opposite headings -- not
ground tracks -- is called for, which means that the flight is
actually between two parallel lines a specified distance apart,
rather than between two points that same distance apart. The
airplane is allowed to drift with any crosswind component. The
FAA's Amateur-Built Aircraft Flight Testing Handbook (AC 90-89)
may favour flying a heading rather than a ground course, but does
not make the distinction clear. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Sources often don&#146;t distinguish between
three ways to carry out this method of runs on opposite headings:
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1a) Fly the track (between the start and finish
points). Use GPS ground speed. Or use time divided by course
distance. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">1b) Fly the heading (perpendicular to parallel
start and finish lines). Use GPS ground speed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1c) Fly the heading (perpendicular to parallel
start and finish lines). Use time divided by distance between
start and finish line on the chosen heading. Or determine the
component of GPS ground speed along the heading direction.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">For a pilot, flying a ground track (#1a) may be
intuitively wrong when attempting to determine true air speed.
The plane is clearly losing out on some speed towards the target
point by having to correct for drift. But flying a constant
heading is no better if the pilot simply uses GPS ground speed
for calculations (#1b). By flying a heading where there is a
crosswind, the ground speed will increase by a similar percentage
as the ground speed would have decreased if flying a constant
track. Even when averaging runs in opposite directions, one
method will slightly over-estimate true air speed from ground
speed, and the other will slightly under-estimate it. For a 100
mph aircraft in a 10 mph crosswind, the errors are about 1/2 %. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The most accurate version is #1c: The key is to
measure the ground speed perpendicular to the start and finish
lines, that is along the chosen flight heading. This component of
the ground speed is unaffected by any crosswind component. Only
in this way does flying headings become superior to flying a
ground track. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">If the wind is a pure crosswind, then its
effect is entirely removed by method #1c. If there is a pure head
or tailwind, its effect is entirely removed by averaging the
speeds from runs in opposite directions. If, however, there is a
combination of crosswind and head or tailwind, the method
provides a very close approximation to the true air speed. For
the 100 mph aircraft in a combined 10 mph crosswind and 10 mph
tail or headwind (i.e., 14.1 mph on a heading 45 degrees from the
course direction), the error in estimating true air speed is a
negligible 0.05 %. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">If doing method #1c the old fashioned way, the
stopwatch is clicked when the start and finish lines are crossed.
With a GPS, some geometry work would be necessary after the
flight, to determine what component of the speed along the track
actually flown is in the direction of the chosen heading.
Airspeed and track information for each leg can be gathered at
different levels of detail. A pilot could simply jot down the
track direction and ground speed from time to time when flying
the leg, averaging them later. Or data could come from the entire
leg flown. The test run would be determined by flying a heading,
marking a start and a finish waypoint with the GPS some minutes
apart, while recording times for these events by stopwatch. If
the GPS has a moving map then it likely has a track log feature
that records a steady stream of time and position data. If
downloaded to a computer, mapping software can be used to
determine an average track and speed. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">No matter which version of the opposite heading
runs method is used, accuracy is improved if the runs can be
flown into and out of the wind, with as little crosswind as
possible. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">By using the version of the method that uses
the component of ground speed along the chosen course heading
(#1c), the calculations are nearly mathematically correct for
determining true air speed. Other versions of the method are less
accurate for most wind conditions, but may be sufficient. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>2) 'AVERAGED HEADING TRIANGLE'</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">EAA's Experimenter magazine, Dec. '97,
reprinted a method that had been printed in the Rans company's
newsletter. The pilot flies three legs with headings 120 degrees
apart. The true air speed is simply calculated as the average of
GPS speeds from the three legs. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Conclusions:</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The method is only an approximation, which the
article does not state. It appears to be more accurate than the
least accurate variations of method #1, but less accurate than
the best version of method #1. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Details: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">For a couple sample calculations with different
wind directions and a 100 mph aircraft in a 10 mph wind, the
error was about 1/4 %. It is as if the method averages out the
errors of the simpler versions of method #1, which were seen to
vary between zero and 1/2 % for the same aircraft and wind,
depending on the wind direction. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">(The article's correction factors for density
altitude are wrong, by the way, since they say to multiply by
values which are the air density ratios rather than the square
root of the air density ratios.) </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>3) 'THREE GROUND SPEEDS AND TRACKS' (OR 'THE
CIRCLE OF VECTORS')</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By flying three legs in different directions,
and recording both ground speeds and tracks, one determines wind
speed, wind direction, and true air speed without approximation.
Some trigonometry is necessary, but the equations are available
on a spreadsheet or can be worked on a scientific calculator.
While headings and speed need to be maintained accurately, it
does not matter what the chosen headings are, and they are not
input into the calculations. Therefore an accurate compass swing
is not necessary. Best results are found for headings 90 to 120
degrees from each other. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">I have also called the method 'the circle of
vectors' because of the method&#146;s underlying logic. Doug Gray
explains the method in the PDF document found at: </font><a

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Conclusions: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">A method that is mathematically correct. It is
simple to fly but the calculation is less straightforward. The
compass used to determine heading need not be calibrated. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Details: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The method is best described in Doug
Gray&#146;s document, but the geometry can be described here
without showing the math. Three legs flown at the same indicated
airspeed can be represented by three equal length true velocity
vectors. These three &#145;arrows&#146; can be moved around so
that their noses all converge at a single spot. As they are all
the same length, a circle can be drawn that is centered on the
single central spot, and runs through the point at the tail end
of each arrow. If wind is added, then the single central spot
will be shifted in a particular direction. The sum of an airspeed
vector and the wind vector results in a ground speed vector.
These three ground speed vectors will point to the new shifted
spot, but still have their tails on the original circle. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">To determine wind speed from observed ground
speed, this system has to be worked the other way around. If
there are three ground speed vectors, put them together so their
noses converge on a single spot. The three points marking the
tails of the arrows will define a circle that runs through the
three points. This circle can be computed mathematically. The
difference between the location of the circle&#146;s centre, and
the point at which one has the ground speed vectors converging,
produces the desired wind vector. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>4) 'THREE TRACKS AT 90 DEGREES, AND
PYTHAGORAS-LIKE FORMULA' </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This method uses one leg in one direction, a
second leg at 90 degrees to the first, and a third leg in the
opposite direction to the first. Ground tracks must be flown, and
only ground speeds are recorded. A formula that has elements
resembling the Pythagorean theorem determines the true air speed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Conclusions: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is another mathematically correct method,
and is essentially a special case of the more general method #3.
Compared to #3, this method probably requires more careful
flying, but requires less data to be recorded, and is simpler to
calculate. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Details: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">I haven&#146;t done the derivation myself but
the numbers work in tests. The formula is: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">true air speed = (square root(A^2 + B^2 + C^2 +
A^2 * C^2 / B^2) )/ 2</font></p>

<p><font size="3">where A, B, and C are the ground speeds for the
three legs in the order described above. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">This formula was presented by David Fox in the
Feb. 1995 issue of Kitplanes (which I haven't seen), and is
referred to in notes associated with the web sites where I found
methods #3 and #5. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">If headings were flown instead of tracks, the
formula would only be an approximation. (For a 100 mph aircraft
with a 10 mph wind perpendicular to the two runs that are in
opposite directions, the error is 0.91%. When the same wind is
parallel to the two runs, the error was a miniscule 0.005%. But
method #1 produces better approximations if one can correctly
guess the rough wind direction relative to its two runs.)</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>5) 'THREE HEADINGS AT 90 DEGREES AND
ITERATIVE CALCULATION'</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Only ground speeds need to be recorded in this
method, but three headings at 90 degrees to each other must be
flown.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Conclusions: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The flying is as for method #4, but requires
specific and accurate headings rather than tracks. Results are
solved iteratively rather than analytically, so programming or
access to the programmer&#146;s website is required. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>Details: </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Data is entered into a Java applet from Craig
Cox at: </font></p>

<p><a href="http://www.reacomp.com/TrueAirspeed/index.html"><font
size="3">http://www.reacomp.com/TrueAirspeed/index.html</font></a></p>

<p><font size="3">It iteratively calculates the true airspeed and
wind velocity. The program shows results to whole number values
only, but more accuracy can be attained by multiplying all inputs
by 100 (and dividing the output speeds by the same amount).
Source code is provided. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>6) &#145;THREE HEADINGS AT 90 DEGREES AND
ANALYTIC SOLUTION&#146; </b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">An analytic solution, not requiring iteration,
is available for the flight and data recording procedure found in
method #5. Formulas are presented by Craig Cox at the same web
site as for method #5. The calculations do require solving for a
quadratic equation, for which the method is left to the reader.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Both Doug Gray's and the iterative method are
recommended at the following site, which has a number of useful
flight testing resources and links: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">http://members.xoom.com/kevinhorton/rvlinks.html</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>OTHER ERROR SOURCES</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">While some of the simpler methods are only
approximations, their errors may be acceptable when considering
other errors in the measurements. Error sources include: </font></p>

<p><font size="3">1) Selective Availability (SA)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The following information on SA is no longer
applicable, as SA was turned off in May 2000, but is retained for
reference.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Selective Availability causes a GPS&#146;s
reported position to slowly wander in a pseudo-random manner. The
speed error with SA turned off is small, about 0.1 mph. While I
don&#146;t have confirmed numbers available, one web site said
that the SA-induced errors are 'typically 0 to 3 mph when at rest
(but can be more), and typically plus or minus 1 mph when
travelling over 60 mph'. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">The motion added by SA is actually independent
of the GPS user's speed, but when the user is moving fast enough
only the error motion parallel to the user's path with have much
of an effect on the displayed speed. (An SA &quot;crosswind&quot;
has less effect on reported speed than an SA &quot;headwind&quot;
or &quot;tailwind&quot;.) So while flying the error introduced
may usually be less than 1 mph. From time to time the wandering
motion will happen to be both rapid and in line with the
aircraft&#146;s track, so GPS speed errors could occasionally be
at least as high at 3 mph, assuming the above information on
position wandering is correct. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Repeating airspeed calibration tests at
different times, at least 15 minutes apart, can improve test
accuracy. Just taking multiple data points during a 5 minute run
may not be sufficient, as the speed and direction of the position
wandering may be similar throughout. While more detail is
available on GPS related web sites, the period of the most
significant SA wandering is very roughly on the order of 10 or 15
minutes. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">2) Display Error</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Some GPS's only show speed to whole mph (or kts
or km/h) when above a value of 100, resulting in plus or minus
one half a unit of inaccuracy. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">3) Variations in wind velocity, and inability
to fly a perfect flight path.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">All the flight test theory in the world may
feel rather academic when one is bouncing around in a small, low
wing loading homebuilt. One may want to climb to an altitude
above much of the low level mechanical turbulence, wind shear,
and thermals. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">4) Compressibility </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Compressibility effects are usually ignored,
but one could look into the issue when dealing with a high speed
homebuilt. The difference between compressible and
non-compressible calculations of speed from pitot pressure differ
by less than 1% if under 200 mph and in the lower atmosphere.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>ALTIMETER CALIBRATION</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The calculations used to determine a
calibration for the air speed indicator can also be used to help
determine corrections to indicated altitude. I doubt that few
except professionals bother with this, as the effects are small
and inconvenient to apply in normal flying, so details will not
be presented here. To make use of the airspeed calibration data
for altimeter calibration, it must be assumed that the errors
resulted from inaccuracy in sensing static pressure rather than
dynamic (pitot) pressure. This sounds reasonable since much more
effort seems to be taken in determining good locations for static
pressure ports than pitot tubes on certificated aircraft. The
correction to indicated altitude is called the &quot;position
error&quot; correction, as the position of the static port on the
aircraft affects the pressure readings. As airspeed errors tend
to change with speed, then so will the altimeter errors, if it is
the static pressure sensing that is not exact. The altimeter
would read differently when doing low passes over a level runway
at different speeds, despite maintaining the same height off the
ground.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>TRAILING CONE or TRAILING BOMB method</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">One method of calibrating airspeed without
using ground speed (and therefore having to compensate for wind)
is the 'trailing cone' method. I have no experience with the
accuracy achievable this way, but it is a method used in
professional flight testing. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Instead of measuring static pressure on the
aircraft, where it is so easily influenced by local pressure
changes in the airflow, static ports are placed on an object
trailed well behind and below the airplane. For stability, this
may have a cone at its trailing end, vertex facing forwards. Or
it may have fins on a body, resembling an aerial bomb. No matter
how constructed, the principle of taking static pressure readings
away from the aircraft applies. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">While trailing devices are normally used only
in professional testing, simple versions can be made at home with
parts such as a plastic funnel and 50' of soft plastic tubing. A
description can be found in Sport Aviation, March 1977, &quot;A
study of Cruise Performance of the T-18&quot; by Howard Henderson
and Peter Roemer. Another design is shown p.23 of Sport Aviation,
February 1974.</font></p>
